# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
- git clone (https://github.com/AmbroTall/savannah-informatics.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
- Where the package.json is located.
  
3. Install dependencies:
- npm install / yarn install
  
4. Running the App
To start the development server and run the app, use the following command:
- npm run dev
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app.

## Running Tests
- I have tests in place to ensure the reliability of the code. To run tests, use:
- npm test
This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on the health of your application.

## Automated Pipeline
I have set up an automated pipeline that runs tests whenever a commit is pushed to the repository. This ensures that the codebase remains stable and tests pass before changes are merged.
